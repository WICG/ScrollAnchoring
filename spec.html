        Changes in DOM elements above the visible region of a
        <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#scrolling-box">scrolling box</a>
        can result in the page moving while the user is in the middle of consuming the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        This spec proposes a mechanism to mitigate this jarring user experience by
        keeping track of the position of an anchor node and adjusting the scroll
        offset accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        This spec also proposes an API for web developers to opt-out of this behavior.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Today, users of the web are often distracted by content moving around due to
        changes that occur outside the viewport. Examples include script inserting an
        iframe containing an ad, or non-sized images loading on a slow network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically the browser's default behavior has been to preserve the absolute
        scroll position when such changes occur. This means that to avoid shifting
        content, the webpage can attempt to reserve space on the page for anything
        that will load later. In practice, few websites do this consistently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scroll anchoring aims to minimize surprising content shifts. It does this by
        adjusting the scroll position to compensate for the changes outside the
        viewport.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section dfn-for="ScrollAnchoring">
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Scroll anchoring works by selecting a DOM node (the <dfn>anchor node</dfn>) whose
        movement is used to determine adjustments to the scroll position.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Anchor Node Selection</h3>
        <p>
          Each <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#scrolling-box">scrolling box</a>
          aims to select an anchor node that is deep in the DOM and close to the
          block start edge of its <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#content">content area</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The anchor node is either a non-anonymous
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#block">block box</a>
          or a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#text">text node</a>.
          The anchor node is always a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#concept-tree-descendant">descendant</a>
          of the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#scrolling-box">scrolling box</a>.
          In some cases, a scrolling box may not select any anchor node.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn id="anchoring-algorithm">anchor node selection algorithm</dfn> for a scrolling box S
          is as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>
              If S is associated with an element whose computed value of the
              <a href="#overflow-anchor">overflow-anchor</a> property is
              <a href="#overflow-anchor-none">none</a>, then do not select an anchor node for S.
            </li>
            <li>
              Otherwise, perform a pre-order depth-first traversal of the DOM subtree rooted at
              S, starting at its first child. For each node N encountered by this traversal:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If N is an <a>excluded subtree</a>, skip over N and its descendents.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If N is <a id="ref-for-fully-visible-1">fully visible</a> in S,
                  terminate the traversal and use N as the anchor node.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If N is <a id="ref-for-fully-clipped-1">fully clipped</a> in S,
                  skip over E and its descendents.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If N is <a id="ref-for-partially-visible-1">partially visible</a>, continue
                  the traversal by descending to the children of N, but if the traversal reaches
                  the last descendant of N without selecting an anchor node, then terminate the
                  traversal and select N as the anchor node.
                  <div class="note">
                    Deeper nodes are preferred to minimize the possibility of content changing
                    inside the anchor node but outside the viewport, which would cause visible
                    content to shift without triggering any scroll anchoring adjustment.
                  </div>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Conceptually, a new anchor node is computed for every scrolling box whenever the scroll position of
          any scrolling box changes. (As a performance optimization, the implementation may wait until the
          anchor node is needed before computing it.)
        </p>
        <p>
          A DOM node N is an <dfn id="excluded-subtree">excluded subtree</dfn> if it is an element and any of the following conditions
          holds:
          <ul>
            <li>
              N's computed value of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#propdef-display">display</a> property is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/#valdef-display-none">none</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              N's computed value of the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#propdef-position">position</a> property is <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#valdef-position-fixed">fixed</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              N's computed value of the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#propdef-position">position</a> property is <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#valdef-position-absolute">absolute</a> and N's
              <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display-3/#containing-block">containing block</a>
              is an ancestor of the scrolling box.
            </li>
            <li>
              N's computed value of the <a href="#overflow-anchor">overflow-anchor</a>
              property is <a href="#overflow-anchor-none">none</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          A DOM node N is <dfn id="fully-visible">fully visible</dfn> in a scrolling box S if its
          <a>scroll anchoring bounding rect</a> is entirely within the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#content">content area</a> of S.
        </p>
        <p>
          A DOM node N is <dfn id="fully-clipped">fully clipped</dfn> in a scrolling box S if its
          <a>scroll anchoring bounding rect</a> is entirely outside the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#content">content area</a> of S.
        </p>
        <p>
          A DOM node N is <dfn id="partially-visible">partially visible</dfn> in a scrolling box S if it
          is neither fully visible in S nor fully clipped in S.

        <p>
          The <dfn id="scroll-anchoring-bounding-rect">scroll anchoring bounding rect</dfn> of a DOM node N

        <h3>Scroll Adjustment</h3>
        <p>
          If an anchor node was selected, then when the anchor node moves,
          the browser computes the previous offset <code>y0</code>, and the current offset <code>y1</code>,
          of the block start edge of the anchor node's <a>scroll anchoring bounding rect</a>,
          relative to the block start edge of the scrolling content in the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#block-flow-direction">block
          flow direction</a> of the scroller.
        </p>
        <p>
          It then queues an adjustment to the scroll position
          of <code>y1 - y0</code>, in the block flow direction, to be performed at the end of the
          <a>suppression window</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Suppression Window</h4>
        <p>
          Every movement of an anchor node occurs within a window of time called the
          <dfn id="suppression-window">suppression window</dfn>, defined as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>The suppression window begins at the start of the current iteration of the
            <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#processing-model-8">HTML Processing Model</a> event loop, or at the end of the most recently completed suppression window,
            whichever is more recent.</li>
            <li>The suppression window ends at the end of the current iteration of the
            <a data-link-type="dfn" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#processing-model-8">HTML Processing Model</a> event loop,
            or immediately before the next operation whose result or side effects
            would differ as a result of a change in the scroll position (for example,
            an invocation of
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view-1/#dom-element-getboundingclientrect">getBoundingClientRect</a>), whichever comes sooner.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="note">
            The suppression window boundaries should be incorporated into the HTML standard once the
            scroll anchoring API is stabilized.
          </div>
          More than one anchor node movement may occur within the same suppression window.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of a suppression window, the user agent performs all scroll
          adjustments that were queued during the window and not suppressed by any
          <a>suppression trigger</a> during the window.
        </p>
        <h4>Suppression Triggers</h4>
        <p>
          A <dfn id="suppression-trigger">suppression trigger</dfn> is an operation that
          suppresses the scroll anchoring adjustment for an anchor node movement, if it
          occurs within the suppression window for that movement. These triggers are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Any change to the computed value of any of the following properties, on any
              element in the path from the anchor node to the scrollable element (or
              document), inclusive of both:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css21/visuren.html#position-props">box offset properties</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css21/box.html#margin-properties">margin properties</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css21/box.html#padding-properties">padding properties</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css21/visudet.html#propdef-width">width</a>,
                  <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css21/visudet.html#propdef-height">height</a>,
                  <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css21/visudet.html#min-max-widths">min-width and max-width</a>,
                  <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css21/visudet.html#min-max-heights">min-height and max-height</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#propdef-position">position</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms-1/#propdef-transform">transform</a></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Any change to the computed value of the
              <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#propdef-position">position</a>
              property on any element within the scrollable element (or document), such that
              the element acquires or ceases to have an out-of-flow position
              (<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#fixed-pos">fixed</a> or
              <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#abs-pos">absolute</a>).
              Note that this trigger applies regardless of whether the modified element is
              on the path from the anchor node to the scrollable element.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          Suppression triggers exist for compatibility with existing web content that has negative
          interactions with scroll anchoring due to shifting content in scroll event handlers.
        </div>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Exclusion API</h2>
      <p>
        Scroll anchoring aims to be the default mode of behavior when launched, so that
        users benefit from it even on legacy content. A CSS property
        <dfn id="overflow-anchor"><code>overflow-anchor</code></dfn> can disable
        scroll anchoring in part or all of a webpage (opt out), or exclude portions
        of the DOM from the anchor node selection algorithm.
        This property supports the following values when applied to an element E:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <dfn><code>overflow-anchor: auto</code></dfn> (the default value) declares
            that the DOM subtree rooted at E is eligible to participate in the
            <a href="#anchoring-algorithm" id="ref-for-anchoring-algorithm-1">anchor
            node selection algorithm</a> for any scrolling box created by E or an ancestor of E.
        </li>
        <li>
            <dfn id="overflow-anchor-none"><code>overflow-anchor: none</code></dfn>
            declares that the DOM subtree rooted at E is <em>not</em> eligible to
            participate in the <a href="#anchoring-algorithm"
            id="ref-for-anchoring-algorithm-1">anchor node selection algorithm</a>
            for any scrolling box created by E or an ancestor of E.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        The <code>overflow-anchor</code> property is also proposed (with different values) for
        <a href="http://tabatkins.github.io/specs/css-sticky-scrollbars/">CSS Sticky Scrollbars</a>.
        This feature is distinct from scroll anchoring, but shares the notion of
        adjusting scroll position in response to content changes, so it makes sense to reuse the
        property name.
      </div>
      <p>
        The <code>overflow-anchor</code> property is not inherited.
